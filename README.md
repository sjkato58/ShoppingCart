## Shopping Cart Challenge

### Introduction

This was a challenge to make some Domain objects which could be used in a shopping cart system, which would allow for applying discounts to the shopping cart.

The Discounts in question include:
A general basket % discount (eg 10% off total basket)
A discount for a specific product (eg 20% off all apples)
A buy 2 get 1 free promotion (eg buy 2 apples, get 3rd apple free)
A combination purchase deal (eg buy 1 sandwich and 1 apple and 1 drink for Â£X price)

Only one discount can be applied to a product. 

### Notes

(14-10-2024) Have currently attempted to get koin to work but am in need to checking out how best to utilise it again as i have been using Hilt more regularly.  Will need to see about expanding on the project so that it cna have UI to fully utilise the Domain layer.

Note: Also need to organise the domain layer better so that it potentially has more modules if required.
